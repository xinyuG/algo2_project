# Melkmans-Algorithm-Visualized-modifier
This is the code for algo2 final project. Add some feature based on the previous project from previous student:
https://github.com/mgold/Melkmans-Algorithm-Visualized



To run the project locally, `npm install && browserify melkman.js -o bundle.js && wget http://d3js.org/d3.v3.js` and open index.html. (the same as before).
<br><br>Note that npm, browserify and wget are need to run the above command:<br> •if you haven't install npm, you can install it on https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm
<br>•if you haven't install browserify, here is the instruction: https://browserify.org
<br>•if you haven't install wget, here is the instruction for mac homebrew https://stackoverflow.com/questions/33886917/how-to-install-wget-in-macos
•if you have access eror, try add `sudo` before the command.
<br><br>
I run it on Visual Studio with Live Server Extension.
But you can also try to run locally with `sudo npm install http-server -g` and then run `http-server`.
